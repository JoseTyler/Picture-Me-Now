# Project-2

My project will display an application that will allow users to find a photographer in their area for any photography needs they may have.

The website will display local photographers that will follow with a portfolio of thier own work along with contact information.

I will have CRD in my first model where users will be able to create, read, and delete a Category. 

The second model will allow users to create, read, update, and delete a photographers info.

The third model will allow users to create, read, and delete a picture.
